## 1. The Problem: Data Rich, Insight Poor
San Francisco generates terabytes of data daily—from 311 calls and police incidents to building permits and legislative agendas. Yet, the city operates reactively. 

*   **Siloed Intelligence**: Police data doesn't talk to Zoning data. Construction permits aren't cross-referenced with fire response times.
*   **Latency**: By the time a dashboard is updated, the crisis has already happened.
*   **Signal Decay**: Critical warnings are buried in PDF attachments and CSV rows, lost in the noise.

We don't need another dashboard. We need a nervous system.

## 2. The Solution: Lighthouse SF
Lighthouse is an **autonomous computational core** that fundamentally changes how urban data is synthesized. It replaces passive visualization with active, agentic reasoning.

Instead of waiting for a human to query the database, Lighthouse deploys a mesh of **9 specialized AI Agents** that actively patrol the digital city 24/7.

### The 3x3 Intelligence Matrix
| Domain | 📊 Data Agent (SODA) | 📰 News Agent (Scraper) | 🏛 Gov Agent (Legistar) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Public Safety** | Real-time APIs (Crime, Fire) | Local Media (NBC, SF Chron) | Safety Committee Agendas |
| **Infrastructure** | 311 Requests, Dig Permits | Utility Alerts (SFPUC) | Budget & Finance Files |
| **Land Use** | Building Permits, Housing | Development News | Land Use Committee |

## 3. How It Works: The Autonomous Pipeline

Lighthouse doesn't just "fetch data." It runs a sophisticated, reliable cognitive pipeline:

1.  **Parallel Fetch**: All 9 agents concurrently ingest data from 3 diverse sources (API, semantic web, document store).
2.  **Cross-Area Roundtable**: Agents don't work in isolation. A dedicated **Gemini 2.5 Pro Orchestrator** forces domain consolidators to debate. 
    *   *Does the road closure in SoMa impact the Fire Dept's response time to the new high-rise?*
3.  **Marathon Loop (Continuous Mode)**: The system never sleeps. It tracks issues over days and weeks.
    *   **Persistent Memory**: It remembers yesterday's data.
    *   **Auto-Escalation**: If a metric is stagnant or worsening, Lighthouse autonomously raises the priority level.
4.  **Generative Video Briefs**: The **Video Agent** converts complex JSON reports into 30-second cinematic executive briefs using **Veo 3.1** and **Imagen 4**. Stakeholders watch the news; they don't read logs.

## 4. Key Technology
Lighthouse is built on the bleeding edge of the Google AI stack:

*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: The wiring of the brain. Handles complex, multi-turn reasoning and cross-domain conflict resolution.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: The reflexes. High-speed, low-latency analysis of raw data streams.
*   **Veo 3.1**: The storyteller. Generates photorealistic video narratives from data signals.
*   **Imagen 4**: The visionary. Creates storyboard frames to visualize future states.

## 5. Vision
We are moving beyond "Smart Cities" (which are just cities with sensors) to **Autonomous Cities**—cities that can observe, orient, decide, and act.

Lighthouse SF is the kernel of that future.
